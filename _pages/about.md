I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science, the University of Warwick, under a joint PhD program between University of Warwick and Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). I received my B.S. degree in physics from Zhejiang University in 2015, and my M.S. degree in data analytics (with distinction) from the University of Warwick, UK, in 2018.

My research interests lie in time series data analysis in IoT, specifically, analyzing spatiotemporal characteristics in IoT data through statistical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning methods. My previous work has focused on using data-driven approaches to address tasks such as missing value imputation, anomaly detection and localization, and data augmentation in time series data.
