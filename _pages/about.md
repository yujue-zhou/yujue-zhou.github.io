I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick under a joint PhD program between University of Warwick and Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). I received the B.S. degree in physics from Zhejiang University, China, in 2015, and M.S. degree in data analytics (with distinction) from University of Warwick, UK, in 2018.

My research interests lie in time series data analysis in IoT. Specifically, statistical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning methods are used to analyze spatiotemporal characteristics in IoT data. Previous work has focused on using data-driven approaches to address tasks such as missing value imputation, anomaly detection and localization, and data augmentation in time series data.
